# ETH Machine Learning Summary

We cherry-pick the most understandable explanations and definitions into one summary to summarize the content of the lecture about Machine Learning of Prof. Joachim Buhmann.

Machine learning algorithms are data analysis methods which search data sets for patterns and characteristic structures. Typical tasks are the classification of data, automatic regression and unsupervised model fitting. Machine learning has emerged mainly from computer science and artificial intelligence, and draws on methods from a variety of related subjects including statistics, applied mathematics and more specialized fields, such as pattern recognition and neural computation. Applications are, for example, image and speech analysis, medical imaging, bioinformatics and exploratory data analysis in natural science and engineering:

nonlinear decision boundary	linear discriminant analysis	gene expression levels Non-linear decision boundary of a trained support vector machine (SVM) using a radial-basis function kernel.	Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of four different auditory scenes: speech, speech in noise, noise and music.	Gene expression levels obtained from a micro-array experiment, used in gene function prediction.

This course is intended as an introduction to machine learning. It will review the necessary statistical preliminaries and provide an overview of commonly used machine learning methods.
